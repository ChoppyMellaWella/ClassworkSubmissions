	//Task

//Create a method with two formal parameters: a String object and a char. 
//Call this method "countChars." This method should count how many times 
//the char shows up in the String and return that number.

//For example, if you pass the method "AAAqAqAA" and "q," the method should 
//return "2."

	//Other examples:

//"AQQQAABHQ" and "A" ---> returns "3"

//"BBBB" and "Q" ---> returns "0"
